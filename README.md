# Transfer_Learning_TL
Developpement of transfert learning methods for custom image recognition <br/>
###Run the code 
run using the following command : python35 transfert_learning_vgg16.py <br/>
### Remarks
-To train the model we have used the '.fit' keras method and we have fixed the 'epochs=10' only for the test. <br/>
So you can try with other value higher than 10 to improve the accuracy of the model <br/>
-The saved trained model are in the forlder 'output_trained_model'
### Results
-Training time is arround 73 minutes <br/>
-loss=0.3300, accuracy: 97.5309% <br/>
-The analysis of the training, loss, and validation as function of epoch numberare in: <br/>
