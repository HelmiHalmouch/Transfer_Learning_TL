# Transfer_Learning_TL
Developpement of transfert learning methods for custom image recognition <br/>

run using the following command : python35 transfert_learning_vgg16.py <br/>
-*Remark*-
To train the model we have used the '.fit' keras method and we have fixed the 'epochs=10' only for the test. So you can tray with other value higher than 10 to improve the accuracy of model <br/>

The analysis of the training, loss, and validation as function of epoch numberare in  : Fig_train_loss_vs_val_loss.png and Fig_train_acc_vs_val_acc.png
